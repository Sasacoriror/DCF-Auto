# DCF-Auto
This is a calculatur that calculates the instrinsic value of a stock.
The user will have to add the ticker symbol of a stock in the top rigth such as (AAPL, MSFT) in capitor letters, then the stock price and the cash flow per share will be added automatically in with the use of the polygon.io API.
The user will have to add the growth rate in manually for now, also the amount of years they plan to keep the stock under (Total Years To Simulate (n)) and the discount rate which should be around 10% - 15%. Then press "regn ut" to calculate and show the instrinsic value also the percentage of change from the current price.
This project is based on the manual calculator i created under the name "DCF-calculator" and the link https://sasacoriror.github.io/DCF-calculator/

I use this project to learn more about JavaScript and how to work with API's.
